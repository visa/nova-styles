title: Responsive 
description: These size variables can be applied to any css property that needs to resize when the component is viewed on a mobile screen.<br /> These variables are defined based on the <code class="w-code v-badge v-badge-subtle">var(--theme-responsive-factor)</code>, which serves as a multiplier when the screen drops below the mobile breakpoint.<br /> This interaction has been introduced to enable bigger touch areas on mobile devices.
classes: ['var(--size-responsive-20)']
tags: []
order: 0

<div class="v-surface" style="padding: var(--size-responsive-20); background-color: var(--palette-default-surface-highlight)">
